# ProPublica Campaign API Data work

This jupyter notebook is a quick work with the [ProPublica Campaign Finance API data](https://propublica.github.io/campaign-finance-api-docs/#campaign-finance-api-documentation).  

So far I have only worked on the [Presidential Campaigns endpoint](https://propublica.github.io/campaign-finance-api-docs/#presidential-campaigns).
